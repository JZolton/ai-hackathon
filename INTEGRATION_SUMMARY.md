## Usage Examples

### Drug Safety Analysis
```python
# Comprehensive safety profile for a drug
safety_profile = await analyze_drug_safety_profile(
    drug_name="ibuprofen",
    include_adverse_events=True,
    include_labeling=True,
    include_recalls=True
)
```

### Health Information Lookup
```python
# Multi-language health information
health_info = await get_multilingual_health_info(
    health_topic="diabetes",
    languages=["en", "es", "zh"]
)
```

### Medical Code Lookup
```python
# ICD-10 code lookup
condition_info = await lookup_by_icd10_code(
    icd10_code="E11.9",  # Type 2 diabetes
    language="en"
)
```

## Data Quality & Disclaimers

### MedlinePlus Connect
- **Source:** National Library of Medicine (NLM)
- **Quality:** Peer-reviewed medical literature and government health agencies
- **Review:** Medical librarians and health professionals
- **Updates:** Regular updates from authoritative sources

### OpenFDA API
- **Source:** U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
- **Limitations:** Voluntary reporting system, potential underreporting
- **Causality:** Reports do not establish causal relationships
- **Completeness:** Not all adverse events are reported

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Monitor API Performance** - Track response times and error rates
2. **Implement Caching** - Consider caching frequently accessed data
3. **Add Rate Limiting** - Implement proper rate limiting for API calls
4. **Expand Language Support** - Consider additional language integrations
5. **Enhanced Analytics** - Add more sophisticated data analysis capabilities
6. **User Interface** - Consider developing a web interface for easier access

## Conclusion

The integration of MedlinePlus Connect and OpenFDA API significantly enhances the MCP server's capabilities, providing:

- **Comprehensive drug safety surveillance**
- **Multilingual health education resources**
- **Professional-grade medical data access**
- **Real-time FDA safety monitoring**
