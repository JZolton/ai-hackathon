## Questions that can be answered using the available MCP servers:

### 1. COVID-19 Surveillance and Response

- *Data Source: CDC Open Data (test-2)*
- *Why it matters: Essential for resource allocation, policy decisions, and public health interventions*

### 2. Healthcare Access and Insurance Coverage
**"Which counties in our state have the highest rates of uninsured residents, and what types of healthcare facilities are available in those underserved areas?"**
- *Data Source: Healthcare.gov (test-3)*
- *Why it matters: Identifies healthcare deserts and guides expansion of services*

### 3. Disease Outbreak Monitoring
**"Are there any emerging infectious disease outbreaks or unusual disease patterns in neighboring states that we should be monitoring?"**
- *Data Source: CDC Open Data (test-2)*
- *Why it matters: Early warning system for potential public health threats*

### 4. Healthcare Market Analysis
**"How have healthcare marketplace enrollment numbers and plan offerings changed in rural vs urban areas over the past year?"**
- *Data Source: Healthcare.gov (test-3)*

### 5. Multi-State Health Comparisons

- *Data Sources: CDC Open Data (test-2) + Healthcare.gov (test-3)*
- *Why it matters: Benchmarking for public health program effectiveness*

### 6. Environmental Health Impact (Limited)
**"While we can't access real-time environmental data, can we correlate historical respiratory disease patterns from CDC data with known environmental events?"**

- *Why it matters: Understanding environmental health relationships despite EPHT limitations*

## Note on Data Limitations:
- **EPHT Server (test-1)**: Currently non-functional - cannot provide real-time air quality, water quality, or environmental exposure data
- **Workaround**: Can use CDC Open Data for health outcome data that may be environmentally related (asthma, respiratory diseases, etc.)
