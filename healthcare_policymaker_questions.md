# Healthcare Policymaker Questions for Available Databases

Based on the available MCP servers and their capabilities, here are 6 strategic questions that healthcare policymakers would care about:

## 1. Drug Safety and Market Access Policy
**"What are the most serious FDA drug safety concerns in the past year, and how do these safety profiles correlate with healthcare marketplace coverage and patient education resources?"**

**Data Sources:**
- **OpenFDA**: Drug adverse events, recalls, enforcement actions, labeling warnings
- **MedlinePlus**: Patient education materials, drug information guides
- **Healthcare.gov**: Insurance coverage patterns, marketplace plan formularies

**Policy Impact:** Informs drug formulary decisions, safety communication strategies, and patient education requirements for insurance plans.

## 2. Health Equity and Access Disparities
**"Which counties have the highest rates of uninsured residents, and how do COVID-19 health outcomes in those areas compare to areas with better insurance coverage?"**

**Data Sources:**
- **Healthcare.gov**: Insurance coverage data, marketplace enrollment by county
- **CDC Open Data**: COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations by geographic area
- **MedlinePlus**: Multilingual health education resources for underserved populations

**Policy Impact:** Guides targeted insurance expansion efforts, public health resource allocation, and health equity initiatives.

## Cross-Database Analysis Capabilities

### Multi-Source Intelligence
These questions leverage the unique strengths of each database:

- **OpenFDA**: Real-time safety surveillance and regulatory enforcement data
- **CDC Open Data**: Population health trends and disease surveillance
- **Healthcare.gov**: Healthcare access, coverage, and system capacity data  
- **MedlinePlus**: Evidence-based patient education and health literacy resources

### Policy Decision Support
The combined data enables policymakers to:

1. **Identify Health Disparities**: Cross-reference insurance coverage with health outcomes
2. **Monitor Safety Signals**: Track drug/device safety issues and their impact on access
3. **Evaluate System Performance**: Assess healthcare delivery effectiveness across different models
4. **Guide Resource Allocation**: Target interventions based on data-driven insights
5. **Improve Health Communication**: Develop targeted education strategies for different populations
6. **Support Evidence-Based Policy**: Make informed decisions using comprehensive, real-time data

### Data Quality and Limitations
- **OpenFDA**: Voluntary reporting system, may underrepresent actual adverse events
- **CDC Open Data**: Surveillance data with potential reporting delays
- **Healthcare.gov**: Administrative data, may not capture all market dynamics
- **MedlinePlus**: Educational content, not real-time clinical data

These questions are designed to provide actionable intelligence for healthcare policy decisions while acknowledging the strengths and limitations of each data source.
